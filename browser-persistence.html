  <h1>Cross-Browser Persistent Storage</h1>
  
  <p>
    Browsers provide built-in storage mechanisms such as <strong>IndexedDB</strong>, <strong>localStorage</strong>, and (formerly) <strong>WebSQL</strong> for persisting data on the client side. However, these storage systems are designed to be <em>local</em> to the browser (and even to a specific browser profile or device).
  </p>
  
  <h2>Local Storage Isolation</h2>
  <p>
    When you use IndexedDB or localStorage:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is stored on the user's device.</li>
    <li>The storage is scoped to the domain (origin) and the specific browser instance.</li>
    <li>Different browsers or devices will have their own isolated copies of the data.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> This means that if you open your textboard app in one browser, the posts are saved only in that browser's storage. Opening the app in another browser (or on another device) will not show those posts.
  </div>
  
  <h2>Shared Persistence Options</h2>
  <p>
    If you need shared persistence—where multiple users or devices see the same data—you have two general approaches:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Server-Side Storage:</strong>  
      Use a backend server with a centralized database (such as MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.) to store and retrieve data. This is the traditional way to build multi-user applications.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Distributed / Peer-to-Peer Solutions:</strong>  
      Some libraries (like <a href="https://pouchdb.com/" target="_blank">PouchDB</a> used with CouchDB or <a href="https://gun.eco/" target="_blank">GunDB</a>) offer a way to synchronize data between local storage and a remote server or between peers. These tools let you build offline-first applications that can later sync data across users.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    In summary, there isn’t a browser-native "flatfile" or database that automatically provides shared persistence across different browsers or devices. Browser storage is inherently local to each user and browser instance. To enable shared, persistent data across multiple users, you need a server or a distributed solution that synchronizes the data.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    For many collaborative or multi-user applications, a centralized backend or a distributed database solution is the way to go.
